## Acceptance Criteria for the Design

A generated `design.md` is considered **acceptable** when:

1. Alignment with Constitution and Increment

   - It clearly references and respects:
     - `CONSTITUTION.md` (values, principles, guardrails, and, if present, `constitution-mode`).
     - The current `increment.md` (goal, scope, non-goals).
   - It stays within the increment’s scope and non-goals.
   - It is clearly grounded in the **current implementation** under the project path:
     - It refers to relevant components, modules, services, and data models as they exist today.
   - It does not introduce scope that contradicts the increment or constitution.

2. Clarity and Implementability

   - Engineers can read the design and understand:
     - Which components must change.
     - Which contracts or data structures are affected.
     - What test behaviors and coverage expectations are needed.
   - It avoids ambiguous phrases like “just update it” without explanation.
   - It is specific enough that implementation can be broken down into small, safe steps.
   - It does **not** include:
     - File paths or per-file action lists.
     - Step sequences or chronological implementation plans.
     - PR groupings or deployment scripts.
     - Specific test file names or test execution sequences.

3. Modern Delivery Readiness

   - The design supports making changes:
     - In **small, incremental steps**.
     - With a clear **test strategy** and **CI integration**, scaled appropriately to the project’s constitution.
   - It explicitly covers:
     - How the change will be safely deployed.
     - How it can be rolled back or mitigated.
     - How it will be observed and monitored.

4. Risk and Trade-offs Visible

   - Major risks and trade-offs are:
     - Named and briefly justified.
     - Not hidden or implied.
   - Potential follow-up work or separate increments is suggested where appropriate.

5. Structure and Style

   - The document follows the structure defined in the design output structure template.
   - It is:
     - Concise but complete.
     - Written in straightforward, technical language.
     - Free of meta-comments about prompts or assistants.
