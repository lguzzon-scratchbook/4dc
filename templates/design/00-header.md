# Prompt: Generate a Technical Design for an Increment

You are going to generate a **technical design** (`design.md`) for a specific increment.

The design turns the **product-level WHAT** defined in the increment into a **concrete technical HOW** that can be implemented safely in the existing codebase.

The `path` argument points at an **increment folder**. This folder already contains `increment.md` and, according to the project’s constitution (“Implementation & Doc Layout”), is where `design.md` and `implement.md` for this increment live.
