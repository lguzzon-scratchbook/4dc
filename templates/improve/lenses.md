# Lenses for Refactoring and Codebase Improvement

## Naming & Clarity (Fowler, Martin, Metz)
- Rename variables, functions, and classes for clarity and intent
- Replace magic numbers/strings with named constants
- Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
- Inline trivial variables
- Use intention-revealing names (Fowler)
- Avoid ambiguous or overloaded names
- Refactor names to reflect domain language (Evans)

## Modularity & Separation (Fowler, Evans, Wirfs-Brock)
- Extract small functions/methods
- Split large functions/classes into smaller units
- Move related code into cohesive modules
- Redesign module boundaries for separation of concerns
- Introduce helper/util modules for shared logic
- Apply Single Responsibility Principle (Martin)
- Decouple UI from business logic
- Use dependency inversion for module boundaries
- Refactor to reduce coupling and increase cohesion

## Architecture & Patterns (Fowler, Evans, Beck, Martin)
- Replace complex conditionals with polymorphism or strategy
- Replace ad-hoc data flow with clear, documented architecture (event-driven, layered, DDD)
- Align divergent implementations (error handling, validation, state management) via ADRs and shared patterns
- Refactor error handling for consistency
- Remove or refactor workaround/hack code
- Introduce design patterns where appropriate (Strategy, Observer, Factory)
- Refactor for testability (Beck, Feathers)
- Apply Domain-Driven Design principles (Evans)
- Document architectural decisions and rationale

## Testing & Reliability (Beck, Feathers)
- Add or improve automated tests for critical paths
- Refactor code to be more testable (dependency injection, isolation)
- Remove dead code and unused imports
- Increase test coverage for edge cases
- Use test doubles and mocks for isolation
- Refactor legacy code to enable testing (Feathers)
- Apply Test-Driven Development (Beck)
- Automate regression testing

## Duplication & Simplicity (Fowler, Thomas & Hunt)
- Consolidate duplicate code
- Simplify conditional logic
- Improve code formatting and indentation
- Remove unnecessary abstractions
- Eliminate speculative generality (Fowler)
- Refactor to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Prefer simple, readable solutions over cleverness

## Documentation & Communication (Martin, Thomas & Hunt)
- Add missing comments for non-obvious logic
- Update documentation to match code
- Document key decisions, trade-offs, and open questions
- Write ADRs for significant architectural changes
- Maintain up-to-date README and onboarding docs
- Use diagrams to clarify architecture and data flow
- Document public APIs and interfaces

These lenses are inspired by leading industry experts: Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Michael Feathers, Robert C. Martin, Rebecca Wirfs-Brock, Eric Evans, Sandi Metz, Dave Thomas & Andy Hunt. They guide the improve/refactor step, focusing on clarity, maintainability, simplicity, modularity, testability, and architectural integrity. Only extract ADRs for impactful changes that align or unify the codebase.
