# LLM-Human Interaction: Improve Step Findings Style Reference

The improve step should be findings-driven, not question-driven. Present factual observations from the codebase, organized by lenses.

## Findings Format

Present each finding as a factual observation with evidence from the codebase:

### Finding 1: [Title]
- **Lens:** [Naming/Modularity/Architecture/Testing/Duplication/Documentation]
- **Observation:** [Factual description of what was found]
- **Evidence:** [Specific file/line references from the codebase]
- **Recommendation:** [Suggested action based on industry best practices]

### Finding 2: [Title]
- **Lens:** [...]
- **Observation:** [...]
- **Evidence:** [...]
- **Recommendation:** [...]

---

Always present findings with facts and evidence. Do not ask the user what to look for; let the lenses and codebase analysis guide recommendations.
