# ADR Output Template

All architectural decisions made during the improve phase must be documented using this format. Reference this template from improvement plans when an ADR is required.

## ADR: [Decision Title]
### Context
Describe the situation, problem, or pattern that led to this decision.

### Decision
State the architectural decision clearly and concisely.

### Consequences
- List the benefits, drawbacks, and trade-offs resulting from this decision.
- Note any impacts on maintainability, extensibility, or performance.

### Alternatives Considered
- [Alternative approach]: Reason not chosen
- [Another alternative]: Reason not chosen

# ADR: Centralize Error Handling in Catalog Module
## Context
Error handling was previously scattered across multiple components, leading to inconsistent behavior and duplicated logic.
## Decision
Centralize all error handling for catalog features in a dedicated module, with standardized error messages and handling routines.
## Consequences
- Improved consistency and maintainability
- Easier to test and extend error handling
- Minor refactoring required for existing components
## Alternatives Considered
- Keep error handling decentralized: Simpler now, but harder to maintain
- Use a third-party error handling library: Adds complexity and dependencies
