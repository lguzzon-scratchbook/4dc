# Goal

Generate a clear, dated improvement document for the project rooted at `path` that:

- Reflects the current health of the codebase with recent increments in place.
- Captures **lessons and emerging patterns** (good and bad).
- Surfaces **architectural and refactoring opportunities**.
- Produces a **list of concrete improvement proposals** that can later be turned into increments, but does not implement them.

The output should help the team and other 4dc prompts decide **what to improve next** and why.
