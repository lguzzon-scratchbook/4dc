# Prompt: Generate Self-Contained increment.prompt.md

You are tasked with generating a fully self-contained `increment.prompt.md` file for the 4DC project. Use the contents of all files in the `/templates/increment` folder (including persona.md, process.md, interaction.md, output.md) as source material. 

- Merge all relevant details from these files into a single prompt file.
- Do not reference or link to any external files or folders in the output.
- The resulting prompt must include the persona, process, pillars, and output format directly in the file.
- Ensure clarity, completeness, and maintainability.
- The output should be ready to use as a standalone prompt for generating a project constitution.

# Output
A single, self-contained `increment.prompt.md` file containing all necessary instructions, context, and templates for increment generation.
