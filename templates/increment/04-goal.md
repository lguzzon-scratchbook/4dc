## Goal

Define the **goal** of this increment as a **clear, outcome-oriented hypothesis**.

The LLM MUST:

1. State the Outcome or Hypothesis

   - Describe what will be different for users or the business after this increment.
   - Phrase it in **product language**, for example:
     - “Users can …”
     - “Customers experience …”
     - “The support team can …”
     - “The business can see … in analytics.”
   - Where relevant, connect to system qualities:
     - Performance, reliability, usability, security, and so on.
     - Still from an outcome perspective (for example: “search feels fast enough under normal usage”).

2. Keep the Scope Small and Focused

   - Ensure the goal is **narrow enough** that:
     - It can be reasonably delivered and released soon.
     - It does not require a broad re-architecture.
   - If the provided description is too broad, the goal MUST:
     - Pick **one coherent slice** to deliver now.
     - Defer the rest to “Follow-up Increments”.

3. Clarify Non-Goals

   - Explicitly list important things this increment **will not** address.
   - This protects against scope creep and misaligned expectations.
   - Examples:
     - “We are not redesigning the full onboarding flow.”
     - “We are not yet optimizing for edge case X.”
     - “We are not committing to full multi-region support yet.”

4. Explain Why This Is a Good Increment

   Briefly explain why this is a good increment:

   - It is **small and self-contained**.
   - It can be **evaluated quickly** (we will be able to tell if the outcome happened).
   - It can flow through the team’s **normal delivery pipeline** without special, risky processes.
