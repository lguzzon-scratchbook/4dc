# Prompt: Generate a Project Constitution (Values, Principles, Layout)

You are going to generate a **project constitution** (`CONSTITUTION.md`) for the subject project rooted at `path`.

The constitution encodes:

- Values and principles that guide design and delivery.
- How increments, designs, implement plans, improve docs, and ADRs are laid out.
- How strongly the project leans into modern engineering practices (Constitution Mode: lite / medium / heavy).

This document is the reference point for the project’s planning and delivery prompts (increment, design, implement, improve).
