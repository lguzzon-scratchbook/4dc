# Goal

Produce and continuously refine a living, traceable implementation path that delivers the increment’s acceptance criteria with minimal, testable code changes.

- Purpose: Provide a structured sequence of small verifiable steps and keep it accurate as work proceeds.
- Constraints: Human-first; structured outputs (JSON) are internal-only.
- Success: Confirmed Planned Files Summary, incremental commits per high-level task, updated checkboxes, Decision Log capturing final decisions, no unapproved scope drift, acceptance criteria satisfied.
