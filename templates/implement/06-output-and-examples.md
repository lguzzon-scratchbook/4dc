## Output Structure and Examples

The generated implementation plan MUST be written to a file named `implement.md` in the **current increment folder** (the folder pointed to by `path`, which already contains `increment.md` and `design.md` according to the project’s constitution and layout).

The plan MUST follow this structure:

1. Implement Title

- First-level heading in the form:
  - `Implement: <Short, Descriptive Title>`
- Usually corresponds to the increment’s goal or the design title.

2. Context (Very Short)

- 2–4 bullet points summarizing:
  - The increment’s goal and key non-goals.
  - The main design approach (one or two sentences).
  - Any key constraints from `CONSTITUTION.md` (for example: mode, relevant principles).
- Links to:
  - `increment.md`
  - `design.md`
  - `CONSTITUTION.md` (by filename only; no absolute paths).

Optionally, you MAY include a simple status line such as:

- `Status: Not started / In progress / Done`
- `Next step: Step N – <short title>`

3. Workstreams

- A short list of named workstreams, for example:

  Section heading: `## 1. Workstreams`  
  Example bullets:
  - `Workstream A – Domain/Backend changes`  
  - `Workstream B – Tray/UI updates`  
  - `Workstream C – Tests and fixtures`  
  - `Workstream D – Observability and metrics`

4. Steps (XP-style Tasks, with optional checkboxes)

Each step is a small, concrete work item. Use a structure like this (shown as plain text, not a fenced code block):

- Section heading: `## 2. Steps`

You MAY use markdown checkboxes to track progress, for example:

- `- [ ] Step 1: Initialize backend package and scripts`  
- `- [ ] Step 2: Add DB wrapper and unit tests`  
- `- [ ] Step 3: Add Express bootstrap and logger`  

For each step, provide details as nested content:

- `### Step 1: [Short actionable task title]`  
  - `Workstream:` [A/B/C/D]  
  - `Based on Design:` [Reference to design section/decision, e.g. "Design §5: Architecture and Boundaries – Catalog list API"]  
  - `Files:` `path/to/file.go`, `another/path/file_test.go`  
  - `Actions:`  
    - [Concrete code-level action 1]  
    - [Concrete code-level action 2]  
  - `Tests:`  
    - [Tests to add/update]  
    - [CI commands to run, e.g. `npm test`, `go test ./...`]  

- `### Step 2: [Short actionable task title]`  
  - `Workstream:` […]  
  - `Based on Design:` […]  
  - `Files:` […]  
  - `Actions:`  
    - […]  
  - `Tests:`  
    - […]  

You MAY group related steps into **phases** if helpful (for example, “Phase 1: Data and domain”, “Phase 2: Route wiring and tests”), but each step must remain small and traceable.

5. Notes on Rollout and Validation

- Optional, but recommended. Use a section like:

  - Section heading: `## 3. Rollout & Validation Notes`  
  - Bullets, for example:  
    - `Suggested grouping into PRs:`  
      - `PR 1: Steps 1–3 (backend domain changes + tests)`  
      - `PR 2: Steps 4–5 (API route and logs + tests)`  
    - `Suggested validation checkpoints:`  
      - `After Step 3: [what to manually or automatically verify]`  
      - `After Step 5: [what to manually or automatically verify]`  

### Acceptance (for the implement.md artifact)

The implementation plan is “good enough” when:

- **Traceability**
  - Every step references at least one part of `design.md`.
  - It is clear how executing all steps will realize the design.

- **Granularity**
  - Steps are small and concrete.
  - A developer can pick any step and understand:
    - Which files to touch.
    - What changes to make at a high level.
    - What tests to write or adjust.

- **XP-friendly**
  - Steps naturally support TDD and pairing.
  - The plan can be executed incrementally with CI, leaving the system in a working or quickly recoverable state.

- **Constitution-aware**
  - The overall level of detail matches `CONSTITUTION.md`:
    - `lite` mode: plan is brief and pragmatic while still clear.
    - `medium`/`heavy` modes: plan is more explicit about checks and safeguards where appropriate.

- **Clarity**
  - The document follows the structure above.
  - It contains no references to prompts, LLMs, or assistants.
