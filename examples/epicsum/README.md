EpicSum
=======

This project helps a controlling person to sum hours booked on tickets. Each ticket can be found in the comment with [<ticketid>] marked. The input is a csv file, see example input.csv and the output should be printed in the console. 

It runs everywhere because it is using bash and no external dependencies. 

If the input contains entries that are missing the pattern in the comment, the program aborts.
