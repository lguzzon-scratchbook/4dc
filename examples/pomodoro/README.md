# Pomodoro demo

This is a tiny demo showing a minimal app + tray wiring for the `4dc` examples. It demonstrates:

- A small domain `internal/app` with a simple timer state machine and tests.
- A platform `internal/tray` package using a systray implementation and a mock for tests.
- A CLI `cmd/pomodoro` with `--smoke` and graceful shutdown on `Quit`.

Quick build & run

```
cd examples/pomodoro
go build -o bin/pomodoro ./cmd/pomodoro
./bin/pomodoro
```

Smoke test (CI / local quick check):

```
./bin/pomodoro --smoke
```

Acceptance (manual):

- The tray/menu shows `Pomodoro`, `Break`, and `Quit`.
- Clicking `Pomodoro` or `Break` triggers the app state change (check logs).
- Clicking `Quit` performs a graceful shutdown and exits the app.
- A minimal red-circle icon is shown in the tray.

Replacing the icon

Currently the demo generates a simple 32×32 red-circle PNG at runtime (no external asset required). To use a custom icon instead, you have two options:

1. Provide a PNG file and update `assets/icon.go` to `//go:embed` it (recommended for a real icon):

	- Place your PNG at `examples/pomodoro/assets/icon.png`.
	- Update `assets/icon.go` to embed and return that file (replace the runtime generator).

2. Or provide a base64-encoded PNG in `examples/pomodoro/assets/icon.txt` and adjust `assets/icon.go` to decode it on startup.

Notes for macOS

- `systray` must be run on the main OS thread on macOS. This demo calls `systray.Run` from `main()` to satisfy that requirement.
- The demo was exercised on macOS; behavior on other platforms may vary.

Testing & smoke

- Unit tests: `go test ./...` (the example includes tests for `internal/app` and `internal/tray` mock).
- Smoke run: `./bin/pomodoro --smoke` initializes subsystems and exits immediately (used for CI/local checks).

PR / branch

If you want me to open a focused PR with these example changes I will create branch `examples/pomodoro-demo` and push the `examples/pomodoro` changes.

Troubleshooting

- If the tray doesn't appear on macOS, ensure the binary is running and check logs printed to the terminal.
