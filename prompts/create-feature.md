# Rule: Generating a Feature Specification

## Persona: Product Owner View

This document represents the **WHAT** - describing individual features from the user's perspective without technical implementation details.

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a lightweight, focused feature specification in Markdown format. Each feature is a **small, testable increment** (subfunction) that validates a specific assumption through Gherkin-style acceptance criteria.

## Prerequisites

Before generating a feature, verify that a `CONSTITUTION.md` file exists in the project root. The constitution defines the project's core principles, technical decisions, and development philosophy.

**If `CONSTITUTION.md` does not exist:**
- Inform the user that a constitution is required first
- Suggest using `create-constitution.md` to generate one
- Do not proceed with feature generation until the constitution exists

**If `CONSTITUTION.md` exists:**
- Read and understand the project's core principles and technical foundation
- Ensure the feature respects constitutional constraints (tech stack, principles, limitations)
- Use the constitution to guide what's feasible and align with project values

## Process

1.  **Verify Prerequisites:** Check for `CONSTITUTION.md` and read it if present.
2.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description of a feature or capability.
3.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Ask only 2-3 essential questions. Provide options in letter/number lists for easy selection.
4.  **Generate Feature:** Create a small, testable increment with Gherkin-style acceptance criteria.
5.  **Save Feature:** Save as `[feature-name]/feature.md`.

## Clarifying Questions (Guidelines)

Ask only 2-3 critical questions to write a clear, testable feature.

### Focus Areas:
- What specific capability/action?
- What assumption are we testing?
- What does success look like?

### Formatting Requirements

- **Number all questions** (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **List options as A, B, C, D, etc.**
- **Always include option X: "Skip this question / I don't know yet"**
- Keep it simple for responses like "1A, 2C, 3X"

### Example Questions

```
1. What specific capability are we building?
   A. Upload/select something
   B. Display/show something
   C. Process/transform something
   D. Save/persist something
   X. Skip this question / I don't know yet

2. What assumption are we testing?
   A. Users want this capability
   B. This approach is technically feasible
   C. This will improve a specific metric
   X. Skip this question / I don't know yet

3. What does success look like?
   A. User completes the action successfully
   B. Specific metric improves
   C. Feature works within time/size constraints
   X. Skip this question / I don't know yet
```

## Feature Structure

Use this structure for all features—small, testable increments with Gherkin-style acceptance criteria.

```markdown
# [Feature Title]

## Job Story
**When** [situation]  
**I want to** [action]  
**So I can** [outcome]

**Assumption Being Tested:** [Specific hypothesis for this increment]

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Given** [precondition]  
  **When** [action]  
  **Then** [observable outcome]

- **Given** [precondition]  
  **When** [action]  
  **Then** [observable outcome]

- **Given** [error condition]  
  **When** [action]  
  **Then** [error handling outcome]

## Success Signal
[How we know this increment works - metric or observation]

## Out of Scope
- [What this increment does NOT include]
```

## Template Example

```markdown
# Upload Profile Picture

## Job Story
**When** I'm setting up my profile for the first time  
**I want to** upload a recognizable photo  
**So I can** build trust with other users before my first consultation

**Assumption Being Tested:** Users will complete profile setup if photo upload takes less than 30 seconds.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Given** I am on my profile page  
  **When** I click "Upload Photo" and select a valid JPG/PNG file under 5MB  
  **Then** I see my new profile picture displayed immediately

- **Given** I am on my profile page  
  **When** I select a file over 5MB  
  **Then** I see an error message "File too large. Maximum 5MB." and can try again

- **Given** I have uploaded a photo  
  **When** I refresh the page  
  **Then** my profile picture persists (saved to my account)

## Success Signal
- 90% of users who start upload complete it successfully
- Average upload time < 15 seconds

## Out of Scope
- Photo editing/cropping (users edit before upload)
- Multiple photo uploads (one profile picture only)
- Camera integration (file selection only)
```

## Important: Separation of Concerns

**Features capture the WHAT, not the HOW:**
- **Features** define small, testable increments with Gherkin-style acceptance criteria
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** capture technical implementation decisions
- **Tasks** break down implementation into actionable steps

Keep features focused on user behavior and observable outcomes. Technical implementation details belong in ADRs and tasks.

**Example structure:**
```
/upload-profile-picture/
  feature.md           # WHAT: User capability (Gherkin)
  adr.md               # HOW: Technical decisions
  tasks.md             # HOW: Implementation steps
```

## Target Audience

Features are read by developers and testers who need clear, testable acceptance criteria for incremental work. They should be understandable without technical jargon, focusing on observable user behavior and outcomes.

## Output

*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** `/tasks/[feature-name]/` or appropriate project directory
*   **Filename:** `feature.md`

## Final Instructions

1. **Verify `CONSTITUTION.md` exists** before proceeding
2. **Read the constitution** to understand project values and constraints
3. **Ask 2-3 clarifying questions** only when essential
4. **Use Gherkin-style acceptance criteria** (Given/When/Then)
5. **Keep it minimal** - one screen max, small testable increment
6. **Focus on observable behavior** - no technical implementation details
7. **Make it testable** - clear success criteria that can be verified
8. **One increment, one assumption** - tight focus on single capability
